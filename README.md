# Wifi testbed source code

This repository contains source code needed to monitor and configure a P2P wifi testbed. Currently work in progress.

Most of the code assumes that the nodes are available as node1-21 in DNS and that automatic ssh logins have been set up.

See [docs](docs/) for more documentation. The main control script is testbed-tools/wifictl.py.
